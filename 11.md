1. If you have a Firebase account, [sign in](https://firebase.google.com/) to it.
If you don't have one, you'll need to [create a Firebase account](https://firebase.google.com/pricing/) A free plan is sufficient for this codelab (and most development for most apps).

2. In the [Firebase console](https://console.firebase.google.com/), click Add project.

3. Enter a name for your Firebase project (for example, "Flutter Essentials"), then set the country/region to the location of your company or organization. Click **Create project**.

4. After a minute or so, your Firebase project will be ready. Click **Continue**.

5. After you've created a Firebase project, you can configure one (or more) apps to use that Firebase project. All you need to do is:

	* Register your app's platform-specific ID with Firebase
	* Generate configuration files for your app, then add them to your project folders

If you're developing your Flutter app for both iOS and Android, you need to register both the iOS and Android versions within the same Firebase project. If you're just developing for one platform, just skip the unneeded section.	

In the top-level directory of your Flutter app, there are subdirectories called ios and android. These directories hold the platform-specific configuration files for **iOS** and **Android**, respectively.

**Configure iOS**

1. In the [Firebase console](https://console.firebase.google.com/), select **Project Overview** in the left nav, then click the iOS button under "Get started by adding Firebase to your app".

2. The important value to provide is the **iOS bundle ID**, which you'll obtain using the following three steps. ( Read [here](https://cocoacasts.com/what-are-app-ids-and-bundle-identifiers/) for more information about iOS bundle IDs.)

3. In the command line tool, go to the top-level directory of your Flutter app.

4. Run the command **open ios/Runner.xcworkspace** to open Xcode. (Read [here](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/General/Reference/InfoPlistKeyReference/Articles/AboutInformationPropertyListFiles.html) for more information about Xcode property lists.)

5. In Xcode, click the top-level **Runner** in the left pane to show the General tab in the right pane. Copy the **Bundle Identifier** value.

6. Back in the Firebase dialog, paste the copied **Bundle Identifier** into the **iOS bundle ID** field, then click **Register App**. (The actual values of *yourcompany* and *yourproject* depend on what you named your Flutter app.)

7. Continuing in Firebase, follow the instructions to download the config file **GoogleService-Info.plist**.

8. Go back to Xcode. Notice that **Runner** has a subfolder also called **Runner**.

9. Drag the **GoogleService-Info.plist** file (that you just downloaded) into that **Runner** subfolder.

10. In the dialog that appears in Xcode, click **Finish**.

11. Go back to the Firebase console. In the setup step, click **Next**, then skip the remaining steps and go back to the main page of the Firebase console.

You're done configuring your Flutter app for iOS!

	
**Configure Android**

1. In the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/), select **Project Overview** in the left nav, then click the Android button under "Get started by adding Firebase to your app". (If you've already added an app (for example, the iOS app from the preceding section), click **Add app**.)

2. The important value to provide is the **Android package name**, which you'll obtain using the following two steps. (Read [here](https://developer.android.com/studio/build/application-id.html) for more information about package and application IDs.)

3. In your Flutter app directory, open the file **android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml**.

4. In the **manifest** element, find the string value of the **package** attribute. This value is the Android package name (something like **com.yourcompany.yourproject**). Copy this value.

5. In the Firebase dialog, paste the copied package name into the **Android package name** field.

6. Click Register App.

7. Continuing in Firebase, follow the instructions to download the config file **google-services.json**.

8. Go to your Flutter app directory, then move the **google-services.json** file (that you just downloaded) into the **android/app** directory.

9. Back in the Firebase console, skip the remaining steps and go back to the main page of the Firebase console.

10. Finally, you need the [Google Services Gradle plugin](https://firebase.google.com/products/dynamic-links/) to read the **google-services.json** file that was generated by Firebase.

```gardle
apply plugin: 'com.google.gms.google-services'
```

11. Open **android/build.gradle**, then inside the **buildscript** tag, add a new dependency:

```gradle
buildscript {
   repositories {
       // ...
   }

   dependencies {
       // ...
       classpath 'com.google.gms:google-services:3.2.1'   // new
   }
}
```

This line specifies version 3.2.1 of the plugin (do not use higher version). For more information, see the Add the SDK section of the [Add Firebase to Your Android Project](https://firebase.google.com/docs/android/setup#manually_add_firebase) documentation.

You're done configuring your Flutter app for Android!
