Your Firebase-Flutter setup is finished, and you're ready to start building your app!

You'll start by setting up Cloud Firestore and initializing it with some values.

1. Open the [Firebase console](https://console.firebase.google.com/), then select the Firebase project that you created during setup.

2. From the left nav **Develop** section, select **Database**.

3. In the **Cloud Firestore** pane, click **Create database**.

4. In the **Security rules for Cloud Firestore** dialog, select **Start in test mode**, then click **Enable**. (Test mode allows any user to read and write to your database, which is convenient during development. However, this can be a security risk. **Before releasing any app to production, you should add [security rules](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/reference/security/)**.)
Our database will have one collection, that we'll name "words". In the collection is where the words and isFavorite flag are stored.

5. Click **Add Collection**, set the collection's name to *words*, then click **Next**.
You can now add documents to your collection. Each document has a **Document ID**, and we'll need to have **word** and **isFavorite** fields.

6. Enter a word using CamelCase letters. For example **TestPair**.

7. For the existing **Field**, enter the value of word, select string for the **Type**, then enter the **Value** of TestPair.

8. Click the **Add Field** icon to add a second field to contain the isFavorite flag. Select boolean for the **Type**, then initialize the **Value** as true.

9. Click **Save**.

10. Add 10 more word pairs by clicking **Add Document**.
