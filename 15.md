In the _buildRow method, find the line that says **onTap: (){}**. Change it to this:
```dart
        onTap: () => pair.reference.updateData({'isFavorite': !pair.isFavorite}));
```
This new line updates the words database reference by changing the value of isFavorite with opposite.

Save the file, then hot-reload your app.
