#Flutter + Firebase

In this part of workshop codelab, you'll learn how to use [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) in [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) app. The app helps new parents choose baby names by letting friends and family vote for their favorites. Specifically, the app accesses a [Cloud Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/products/firestore/) database, and a user action in your app (i.e., tapping a name option) updates the database using a transaction.
